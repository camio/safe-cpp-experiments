# Safe C++ Experiments

This repository contains experimental code exploring Circle's memory-safe
C++ features. The intent is to identify necessary changes to the standard
library and assess their ergonomics.

- [vector.h](vector.h) implements a subset of `<vector>` with memory-safe
  extensions
